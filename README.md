# Stata new commandï¼šlpoly2--Perform two-dimensional local polynomial regression

Unlike `lpoly` and `lpoly1`, `lpoly2` can perform two-dimensional local polynomial regression, and get mixed partial derivatives of the fitted value to independent variables accordingly. For more details, reader can `help lpoly2` in Stata after `wmt install lpoly2`.

Please refer to [this page](https://github.com/Meiting-Wang/wmt) for the installation of `wmt` command.
